    "\n",
    "1. Collect high-quality data: The quality of the data you use to train your model is one of the most important factors in\n",
    "    determining its performance. Make sure you collect a representative sample of data and clean it thoroughly to remove any\n",
    "    errors or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the process of selecting, extracting, and transforming the features (i.e.,\n",
    "    variables) in your data to improve the performance of your model. It is important to choose the right features, scale \n",
    "    them appropriately, and remove any redundant or irrelevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the noise in \n",
